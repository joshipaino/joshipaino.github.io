Everyone loves a good dramatic film or books, and the best ones are those that give the sensation of leaving hooked from beginning to the end.  If you've seen Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame or read through the entire collection of Harry Potter books, then certainly you've experienced such a sensation.  Maybe you've also experienced memorable stories in places outside of mainstream media.  Either way, there's a certain pattern of how these stories keep you engaged.  There's a design of why certain scenes leave you at the edge of your seat; patterns that become useful tools in narrative storytelling.  As film and books have design patterns in telling dramatic stories, design patterns are also part of software development and in creating functional applications.  

## The Norm

Design patterns within software engineering are the tried and true means of creating functional software.  Being able to create something from scratch can often present many approaches on how to make the said something.  So much so that going in blind without a plan may yield to frustration and failure.  The design patterns in software engineering solves this potential problem by providing structure on how to design applications.  Through trial and error of the software engineering field, various design patterns have been introduced such as: prototype, observer, Model-View-Controller as well as many more.  Going over all of them may turn this essay into an encyclopedia, but they are the norm of how software can be implemented.

##  Dramatic Designs

Perhaps a prominent design pattern in the software development is that of the Model-View-Controller heavily present in many modern frameworks of today.  In storytelling, there is pattern of implementing dramatic structure that is the standard of creating tension and suspense.  Similarly, the pattern of the Model-View-Controller is perhaps the standard of displaying system information in a way that is presentable to the user via views, controllers and models.  While the thought process of the model can be complex, in short, the view that a user sees can create an event that affects the controller which in turn affects the model that will affect the view.  Yet, there are multiple ways these three pieces can interact with one another  In an application that I am currently working on that allows users to create budget recipes, the Model-View-Controller is a part of our system design.  A user can click on a page that presents their created recipes to which a controller manipulates the model to retrieve the appropriate information where it is then presented for the user to view.
