Truth be told, I don't think I could be an artist.  An old middle school teacher would look at my drawings as if they wanted to say: "What is this?"  Art teachers were a challenge to impress.  In high school, a girl would turn me down after I showed a "cute" little drawing.  Maybe to her it wasn't so cute.  As I recall these memories, they were embarrassing to say the least, and presenting them here might be too embarrassing for my cup of tea. From these painful experiences, maybe and perhaps the artistic field was a field I was destined not to be in.  That was what I initially thought until I discovered the existence of UI frameworks.  There was a sense of relief as well as glee when there is something out there that can not only streamline and simplify the designing of web pages, but also save me from another artistic embarrassment. 

## The Easy Life

The websites of today are all about being artsy and stylish.  Raw HTML and CSS at its basic form simply won't cut it.  While with enough tinkering, one can certainly create something pretty.  However, to do so takes a lot time and effort, and fortunately I am lazy to design intricate implementation. I say fortunately because it gives me the opportunity to implement a UI framework: the means of quickly setting up a web page layout that can look visually clean and appealing.  These frameworks are the blessing of performing the heavy work such as having a concise style of buttons, menus, etc.  All the necessary and intense needs of customization are simply taken care of and available at one's fingertips.

Implementing a UI framework element can be simple as calling a div class and communicating your needs with English.  Building a three column layout in raw HTML and CSS would require on tweaking of margins and paddings to adjust everything properly.  In a UI framework such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), a three column layout can be simple as <div class="ui three column grid container>. Adding on, one can implement a big blue button with simply <button class="ui big blue button">.  In five words or less, one can lay out a clean presentable set of information.  In five words or less, one can lay out the ground-works of art.

## It's actually not so simple

Of course such simplicity does present its complications in the same vein of pure HTML and CSS.  Simplification and easy of use are often a double edge sword.  In a framework such as Semantic UI, not everything can be described as big and blue upon initial disappointment.  Not all words can be applied to certain piece of the framework; trial and error is bound to happen on what works.  Additionally, there's also scripts to worry about with pieces such as dropdown menus.  As one can see, there's almost an overwhelming amount of items to comprehend.  Typically, HTMl and CSS are normally described as "easy to pick up, hard to master," and UI frameworks are no exception.

Yet, just like simple HTML and CSS, UI frameworks can be satisfying to master.  Overcoming the learning curve allows one to make up the frameworks shortcomings with CSS customization.  If one really wanted everything to be big and blue, they can with enough tweaking (though if we're trying to make art, maybe not everything should be big and blue)  Additionally, with enough practice, understanding a framework and all the aspects of its natural language will be just like learning another language and its vocabulary.
