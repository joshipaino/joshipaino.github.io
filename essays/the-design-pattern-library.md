There is no secret that the library in our local neighborhoods or college campuses can be considered a gold mine to satisfy one's academic needs.  Whether there is the need to borrow a book that dates back years ago, look up an article in the local databases, or to simply sleep in the study spaces, what often goes unnoticed are the systems in place to keep the place nice and organized.  One might say that there is an established design pattern on how a library function.  Software engineering is also no secret to having established design patterns that allows applications to also be nice and tidy.
