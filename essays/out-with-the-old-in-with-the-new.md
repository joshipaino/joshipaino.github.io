Truth be told, I never could be an artist.  An old middle school teacher would look at my drawings as if they wanted to say: "What is this?"  In high school, a girl would turn me down after I showed a "cute" little drawing.  As I recall these memories, they were embarrassing to say the least. From these painful experiences, maybe and perhaps the artistic field was a field I was destined not to be in.  Thus, upon discovering the existence of UI frameworks, there was a sense of relief as well as glee when there is something out there that can save me from another artistic embarrassment. 

The websites of today are all about being artsy and stylish.  Raw HTML and CSS at its basic form simply won't cut it.  While with enough tinkering, one can certainly create something pretty.  Yet, to do so takes a lot time and effort, and fortunately I am lazy to design intricate implementation. I say fortunately because it gives me the opportunity to implement a UI framework: the means of quickly setting up a web page layout that can look visually clean and appealing.  These frameworks are the blessing of performing the heavy work such as having a concise style of buttons, menus, etc. or implementing a clean input.  Something that was once tricky in raw HTML like setting up columns can be easily to implement with a UI framework with <div class="ui three column stackable grid">.  Making a stylistic website just got easier.
