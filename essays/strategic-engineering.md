Life is always a battle.  The experience of battle take all sorts of form whether it may be the experiences of one's daily job, drama in a friendship circle, or the unexpected landing of a fly on your sandwich.  Conflict is always in arise, yet they are unique situations that force us to assess our resources and critically think on the spot to develop strategies on how to emerge victorious.
