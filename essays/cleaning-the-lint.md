## To be Lazy yet To be Perfect
According to the words of one my introductory to Computer Science professors, "all programmers like to be lazy."  The more I dabble into software engineering the more I find this statement to be true; my professors want to write less lines of code and I now I want to write less lines of code.  At the same time, I have also noticed that software engineers are meticulous in what they create, as I too am detailed oriented in what I code.  To be lazy yet to diligent. How can software engineers (or any person for that matter) be both at the same?  These two characteristics are almost contradictory to one another. Yet surprisingly, in practice, one would be surprised on how these two characteristics enhance the craft of software engineers.

## Autonomous Cleaning
When it comes to coding any type of project (even as simple as a "Hello World" project), the simplest of details can mess up the program.  Perhaps there was a lack of a semi-colon that went noticed.  Maybe a variable that was initiated with "let" should have been initiated with a "const" instead.  Or perhaps tracing the problem is too unwieldy because of inconsistent indentation and spacing.  Most likely, we as software engineers are bound to make these mistakes sometimes as we are all bound to mess something up in the plan of asking someone out.
