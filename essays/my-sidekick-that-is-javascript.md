To dabble with Javascript with barely any experience was to go against the practices that I have been accustomed to due to experiences with C, C++, and Java.  The feature set that Javascript and ES6 provided was convenient as it was jarring.  Yet, taking the intiative to explore online tutorials and videos, I came to ultimately appreciate the quirks that Javascript as a language provided.  The uniqueness of Javascript provides a different take on what has become the norm in other languages.

One of the fundamentals in other languages is the identification of a variable's data type or the return value of a function.  With this concept etched into my mind, simply setting a variable to var, let, or const did not feel right.  Shouldn't the variable be specified with a float, a string, or maybe a character array?  Javascript was the first language to tell me, "you don't need to worry about that."  This is just one of the various features Javascript has to make code easier to read and write.  Javascript also made life easier by allowing functions to have the ability to be assigned to variables or even condensed with arrow functions.  Looking at the various features. There's a common theme providing readability and simplicity. So unless you're concerned with manipulating proper memory allocation and pointers in a language like C or C++, there is an appreciation to be made on the convenience that Javascript provides.

I've come to appreciate the convenience of Javascript even more when the interview process of the software engineering field is filled with stressful and time-intensive coding challenges.  WOD's (Work of the Day) that serve as practice for these scenarios demonstrate how Javascript can work with you to tackle these problems.  Javascript lets me condense the writing of a certain function, or forgives me if I omit a semicolon; they were like a sidekick who had my back.  Through constant practices of WOD's, I rarely had to fight with syntax in the future WOD's which allowed me to focus on the problem at hand and most likely shaved second off my time.  If the entrance to future software engineering positions that focus on Javascript is just like the WOD's, then I most certainly look forward to working with the language in the future.
