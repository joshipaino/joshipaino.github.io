The National Student Exchange program is an experience for college students to explore and attend participating institutions across different locations across the U.S.  Normally the duration of one's exchange usually lasts for one semester, however, I decided to participate in the program for a year (Fall 2019 - Spring 2020).  The ability to attend a new university provided unique opportunities such as living in a new environment, meeting new individuals, and participating in events exclusive to the campus. 

During my time at CSU: Northridge, I was able to adjust to a different lifestyle after personally living in Hawaii for most of my life.  This adjustment allowed me to broaden my perspective that goes beyond the state in the Pacific Ocean.  I discovered new problems that are yet to be solved in the area such as environmental issues.  However, I also discovered new opportunities to potentially work with start-ups who aim to solve such problems.  I joined up with ACM @ CSUN who offered their own unique experiences that differed from ACM @ Manoa.  I also conversed with local companies and guest speakers who came to the campus for networking potential.  In the end, to return back to UH: Manoa with these new experiences allowed me to gain new insight about the world and the college education system that I would have otherwise not have noticed or experienced.

After my return as a full-time UH student, I also advertised this program to interested college and high school students through the means of social media as well as the creation of a video promotion.  As part of a scholarship, I try to further promote the program whenever requested by the program organizers.
